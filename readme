Short program which allows my daughter to write with her finger in air, and therefore practice writing in a fun way.

Program can detect one hand, whose index finger becomes a pointer to write in the air.
There are two modes in air_note:
 - selection mode is on only when index and middle finger are close to each other. That allows user to stop writing,
 randomly select new letter, and quit program;
 - painting mode where index and middle finger are far from each other, allows user to write, or paint with index
 finger.

Whole air_note is based on cv2 which captures camera input and numpy.zeros table which shadows camera input creating
canvas and saves index finger moves. After that image of camera and canvas are blended together to
create trace of tip of index finger on real time camera image.
